# Predictive-Modeling-for-Alzheimer-s-Disease
Developed a predictive model for Alzheimer's disease stages using MRI image data. Focused on four classes: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, NonDemented, and Very Mild Demented. The model aimed to aid in early diagnosis and treatment planning, improving patient outcomes.

Executive Summary:

This project aims to analyze MRI image data to predict the stage of Alzheimer's disease, with the
goal of creating a highly accurate model. By leveraging meticulously collected and verified data,
the results will help in early diagnosis and treatment planning, ultimately improving patient
outcomes.

Problem Statement:


Background: Accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease stages is crucial for timely and
effective treatment, reducing patient suffering and healthcare costs.

Objective: Develop a predictive model to accurately determine the stage of Alzheimer's disease.

Scope: Focus on four classes of MRI images: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, NonDemented, and Very Mild Demented.
